My website. It combines Jekyll, Grunt and SCSS. Integrated History API with Jekyll using a JSON generator for all posts and pages. JavaScript concatenation, minification and SCSS compilation and compression are automated using Grunt tasks. The performance improvements I have seen are incredible. I will blog about it one day.
